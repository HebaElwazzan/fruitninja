Fruit Ninja
A game where user slices fruits and tries to beat their highscore.
Assumptions made:
	The user quits from inside the game itself.
	If the user does not quit from the game itself, problems could occur.
	An attempt to fix this problem was made by using a thread that works before closing but it does not seem to be working inside the GameScreenController to stop the animation.
	The user runs the game from an IDE.
	After failing to create a runnable jar file that works outside the program file, it was decided that the user should run the game from an IDE for the game to work correctly.
